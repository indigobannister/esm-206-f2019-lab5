```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Objectives:

- Getting counts for different groups
- use {lubridate} to parse dates
- find confidence intervals aand do t-tests with t.test()
- Heatmap with geom_tile()

```{r, include = FALSE}

# Load in packages
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)

# Load in needed data & clean 
lobster_abundance <- read_csv(here("data","lobster_abundance.csv"), 
                              na = "-99999") %>%
  clean_names()

```


Use the tidyr::uncount() function to expand a frequency variable:
```{r}
lobster_tidy <- lobster_abundance %>% 
  tidyr::uncount(lobster_count)
```


Yay! Now each lobster has its own row. This is tidy format.
